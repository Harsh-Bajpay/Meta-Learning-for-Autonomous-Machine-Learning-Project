# Autonomous Machine Learning with TPOT

This project demonstrates the use of TPOT (Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool) for automated machine learning on a synthetic classification dataset.

## Overview

The script performs the following tasks:
1. Generates a synthetic classification dataset
2. Prepares the data for machine learning
3. Uses TPOT to automatically find the best machine learning pipeline
4. Evaluates the model's performance
5. Exports the best pipeline for future use

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tpot

You can install these dependencies using pip:
